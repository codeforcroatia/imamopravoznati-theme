        Under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), it’s everyone’s right to request
        information from the Croatian government and public bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= site_name %> shows you how to make a Freedom of Information request and
        access information about central government, local government, parliament,
        the armed forces, state funded schools and universities and other
        public authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also use the site to find out information that regulators hold
        about businesses, charities and other organisations.

    <dt id="premise">How does the site work? <a href="#premise">#</a> </dt>
    <dd>
      You choose the public authority that you would like information from, then
      write a brief note describing what you want to know. We then send your
      request to the public authority. Both your request, and any response
      received, are automatically published on the website for you and anyone
      else to find and read.

      <p>
        Public bodies are funded by the public purse: you pay taxes, and then
        government funds its activities with your money: all sorts of things
        that affect your life, from health care through to national defence.
        Some it does well, some it does badly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it’s your money that public bodies are spending, you might be
        interested to check that they are running efficiently, making good
        decisions, and doing the job they are supposed to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more we find out about how government works, the better able we are
        to make suggestions to celebrate the things that are done well, and
        improve the things that are done badly. Some people and organisations
        use the site for research; others for journalism, campaigning or
        awareness-raising. Some are simply curious.

      Under Freedom of Information (FOI) law, or sometimes other access to
      information laws, public authorities have to respond. The response will
      either contain the information you want, or give a legal reason why it
      has not been provided.

        Requests for personal information and vexatious requests are not
        considered valid for FOI purposes. See our <a href="<%=

        information on how we expect people to use this site.

        If you believe a request is not suitable, you can report it for
        attention by the site administrators.

      <p>
        If a request has already been reported to the site administrators, you
        can’t report it a second time - this is to prevent the administrators
        being notified multiple times about the same issue before they’ve had
        a chance to conduct a review.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where a request that you think should be taken down has been previously
        reported, but a decision has been made not to remove it from public
        view, you can use the form in the sidebar of the request page to contact
        the administrators.

        We have over <%= number_with_delimiter(User.count.round(-3), :locale => @locale) %>

      <p>
        But that’s just the people who request information. Most visitors to our
        website don’t make requests themselves, but benefit from being able to
        access information that’s held in the requests and responses of others.
        Around hunderd thousand people per year visit the site.
