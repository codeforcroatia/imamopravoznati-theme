<dt id="purpose">What is <i><%= site_name %></i> for? <a href="#purpose">#</a> </dt>
<dd>
<p>
To help you find out inside information about the Croatian Government and Croatian public bodies.
The site helps people access information about central government, local government,
Parliament, the national health services, the armed forces, state funded schools and universities and
other public authorities.
</p>
<p>
You can also use the site to find out information that regulators hold about businesses,
charities and other organisations.
</p>
</dd>

<dt id="premise">How does the site work? <a href="#premise">#</a> </dt>
<dd>You choose the public authority that you would like information from, then
write a brief note describing what you want to know. We then send your request
to the public authority. Any response received is automatically published on the
website for you and anyone else to find and read.
</dd>

<dt id="whybother_me">Why would I bother to do this? <a href="#whybother_me">#</a> </dt>
<dd>You pay taxes, and then government does things with the money. All sorts of
things that affect your life, from health care through to national defence. Some
it does badly, some it does well. The more we find out about how government
works, the better able we are to make suggestions to improve the things that
are done badly, and to celebrate the things that are done well.
Some people also use the site for research.
</dd>

<dt id="whybother_them">Why would the public authority bother to reply? <a href="#whybother_them">#</a> </dt>
<dd>Under Freedom of Information (FOI) law, they have to respond. The response
will either contain the information you want, or give a valid legal reason why
it has not been provided.
</dd>

<dt id="useful">Does useful information get released through the site? <a href="#useful">#</a> </dt>
<dd>
Yes. Thousands of documents have been released through the site.
