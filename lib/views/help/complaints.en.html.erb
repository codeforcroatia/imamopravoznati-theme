      How do we deal with complaints about us?

    <dd>
      <p>
        If you have a complaint about the way we are running the <%= site_name %>
        service, please <a href="<%=  help_contact_path %>">contact the admin
        team</a>. Those seeking to make complaints via other routes will be
        directed to the admin team.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are unhappy with the way a matter has been handled by one team
        member, you can request that another member of the team review what has
        taken place and seek to resolve the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <%= site_name %> team will seek to apply the site’s existing policies
        or discuss adapting the policies to respond to any novel circumstances
        which arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        We endeavour to deal with complaints promptly; occasionally we decide to
        wait for one of our regular monthly meetings to discuss a case, we will
        inform you if that is happening in relation to a matter you have raised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having been through these two phases, should you remain unhappy with a
        decision made by the <%= site_name %> team, you may request that the
        matter is discussed internally with a group including Code for Croatia’s
        Chief Executive and trustees. Code for Croatia is the parent organisation
        of <%= site_name %>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the trustees are responsible for the running of
        <%= site_name %>. If required, Code for Croatia’s Chief Executive will
        make a recommendation to the trustees who will make the final decision
        on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <%= site_name %>’s activity is subject to national law regulation.
        Those who remain dissatisfied are welcome to use these and other
        external routes of complaint and appeal open to them.
