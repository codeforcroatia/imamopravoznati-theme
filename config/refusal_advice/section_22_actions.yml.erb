          Ask for an internal review, citing ICO guidance and asking the authority to provide evidence that the public interest test was conducted in this case.

          The authority appears to have acted correctly on this point, though you may wish to examine the details given about the public interest test to see if you think it has been applied fairly.

    - id: s22-a4
      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q2, operator: is, value: 'no' }
      advice:
        plain: >
          Ask for an internal review, pointing out that ICO guidance indicates that the authority should include their reasoning.

          You may have grounds for an internal review. Consider the advice above and then decide.

      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q3y1y1y2, operator: is, value: 'yes' }

        plain: >
          The ICO states that in general, "it is in the public interest to allow researchers to complete their programme of research and finalise their findings before the research programme is subjected to external scrutiny".
          
          While you may have a case for requesting an internal review, note that this exemption may be applied more broadly to research than to other areas.

    - id: s22-a10
      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q4, operator: is, value: 'yes' }
      advice:

          Request an internal review, citing this guidance.

    - id: s22-a11
      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q4n1n1, operator: is, value: 'yes' }
      advice:
        plain: >
          In the case of research, the ICO states, "The exemption will include a wide range of information relating to the research project, and will cover information that is not necessarily going to be published. In other words there does not need to be any intention to publish the information that has been requested." It appears that the authority has acted within their rights in this case.

    - id: s22-a12
      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q4n1n1, operator: is, value: 'no' }
      advice:
        plain: >
          For cases other than research, a general intention to publish information in the same general area will not suffice, and this exemption cannot be applied if there has not been an analysis of the materials to discern which parts will be included in a public release. Equally, it is not enough for the public authority to note that it will include some, but not all, of the information requested for future publication.

          Request an internal review, citing ICO guidance and asking the authority to provide any information which falls outside that which they plan to publish.

    - id: s22-a13
      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q5, operator: is, value: 'no' }
      advice:
        plain: >
          Request an internal review, citing this guidance and asking the authority to confirm a publication deadline or the conditions under which publication will occur.

    - id: s22-a14
      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q5y1y1, operator: is, value: 'no' }
      advice:
        plain: >
          If you are certain that the information has not been published and the date or trigger for its publication has now passed, request an internal review citing this point.

    - id: s22-a15
      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q5y1y1y1, operator: is, value: 'no' }
      advice:
        plain: >
          Request an internal review. ICO guidance says that this exemption cannot be applied to information which may have been intended for publication but which was subsequently discarded.

    - id: s22-a16
      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q5y1y1y1, operator: is, value: 'yes' }
      advice:
        plain: >
          The ICO states, "So long as the research programme continues, the exemption may apply to the information if there is an intention for [one or more reports] of the outcome to be published at some point in the future. This is the case even if a report has already been published about a particular aspect of the same research programme." The authority appeared to have applied this exemption correctly.

      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q5n1, operator: is, value: 'yes' }
      advice:
        plain: >
          You may have grounds to request an internal review. Consider the ICO advice alongside any information the authority has provided about a public interest test, and if you think this factor could sway the decision, include it in your response.

      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q6, operator: is, value: 'no' }

      advice:
        plain: >
          Respond to the authority, including these reasons and asking them if they can provide the information in a different format.

      advice:
        plain: >
          The authority can apply this exemption until the last planned report has been published. You may wish to return to your request after this happens, and go through these questions again.

    - id: s22-a23
      show_if:
      - { id: s22-q8y1y1, operator: is, value: 'no' }
      advice:
        plain: >
          Request an internal review, citing this guidance and asking the authority to demonstrate their reasoning on this point.

          You may wish to argue this point, although note that this is 'best practice' rather than an obligation according to the ICO.
