        Did the authority receive the information which you requested from another source (which could be a person, a company or a different authority)?
    hint:
      plain: >
        This exemption does not apply unless the information comes from a source external to the authority itself.

        However, it can apply to information generated by the authority through processes such as transcripts of testimonies, information written up from interviews with a patient, or minutes taken during private meetings that express the views of external contractors.

    hint:

        The exemption can only be applied to the parts of the information that were provided in confidence, unless disclosing the remaining information would also breach the confidence of the source.

    hint:
      html: >
        Under Section 41 of the FOI Act authorities are permitted not to <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1166/when_to_refuse_to_confirm_or_deny_section_1_foia.pdf">confirm or deny</a> whether they hold information, IF doing so would result in an 'actionable brief of confidence' (ie a breach that would stand up in court).

        Have they performed a public interest test on the matter of whether to confirm or deny?
    hint:
      html: >
        Where an authority uses Section 41 as a reason not to confirm or deny whether they hold information, they must also perform a public interest test on this matter. The ICO <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1166/when_to_refuse_to_confirm_or_deny_section_1_foia.pdf">provides guidance to authorities about confirming or denying here</a>.

        Has the authority demonstrated that this information has "the necessary quality of confidence"?

        <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1432163/information-provided-in-confidence-section-41.pdf">ICO guidance</a> says that the authority should be able to demonstrate that the "someone has a genuine interest in the contents remaining confidential". This may take into account the right to privacy as enshrined in the Human Rights Act (if disclosure of the information would impinge on this in the case of the identified person).

        Would disclosure bring new information into the public domain?
    hint:
      html: >
        The authority should consider whether the same or similar information is already in the public domain. <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1204/information-in-the-public-domain-foi-eir-guidance.pdf">The ICO gives guidance about this point here</a>.

        An example would be where the request is for a testimony which contains facts that have already been published elsewhere. While the testimony may not have previously been disclosed, the information within it is already accessible.

        Could the authority release some of the information without breaching confidence?
    hint:
      html: >
        The authority should only apply this exemption to information which breaches confidence. Read <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1432163/information-provided-in-confidence-section-41.pdf">the ICO guidance</a> to understand this point in more detail.

        Has the authority demonstrated that the breach in confidence would be actionable, and likely to succeed, in a court of law?
    hint:
      html: >
        <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1432163/information-provided-in-confidence-section-41.pdf">ICO guidance</a> explains that one of the ways to ascertain whether release of information would constitute a breach of confidence is to consider whether it would be actionable, and then, whether such an action would be likely to succeed. The authority needs to demonstrate its thinking on this point, which will also involve a version of the public interest test in which they will balance the public good of any disclosure against the breach of confidence: "This is because case law on the common law of confidence suggests that a breach of confidence won’t succeed, and therefore won’t be actionable, in circumstances where a public authority can rely on a public interest defence".

        <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1432163/information-provided-in-confidence-section-41.pdf">ICO guidance</a> says that this exemption does not generally apply to contracts, although if 'technical information' or the contractor's 'pre-contractual negotiating position' has been included in a contract, there may be a case for redacting these parts.

        <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1432163/information-provided-in-confidence-section-41.pdf">ICO guidance</a> states, "If the requested information is commercial in nature then the disclosure will only constitute a breach of confidence if it would have a detrimental impact on the confider."
