          Ask for an internal review, repeating the circumstances that mean the information is not accessible to you, and citing <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1203/information-reasonably-accessible-to-the-applicant-by-other-means-sec21.pdf">ICO guidance</a> as well as any relevant legislation.

          When Exemption 22(2)(b) is applied, <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1203/information-reasonably-accessible-to-the-applicant-by-other-means-sec21.pdf">ICO guidance</a> states that the information 'cannot automatically' be considered as reasonably accessible. However, it also says that "information that is only available for inspection can still be considered to be reasonably accessible to the applicant under other parts of section 21". It is worth reading this guidance in full to see whether it is relevant to your case.

          If exemption 21(2)(b) has been applied, read the ICO guidance and consider requesting an internal review if you can make a good case for disclosure.

          Even though it might be convenient for you to inspect the information, it might be worth asking for an internal review, questioning whether the information is in fact “reasonably accessible”, when access is allowed to that information only in one physical location. Given that the request is being made in public on WhatDoTheyKnow, if the review is successful, it allows those members of the public who might not be able to inspect to also access the information.

          There may be a law setting out fees for the information you have requested, so the authority will have good grounds to challenge any request for internal review. But if the authority routinely charges for information held elsewhere, and may not have considered how reasonable it is in the case of this specific information, it might still be worth considering an internal review request to challenge this stance.

          Request an internal review, citing the reason why the payment may not be reasonable in your case.

          If you think there is a good argument for saying this information is not reasonably accessible to you because of the payment required, consider requesting an internal review. Cite the reason why the payment may not be reasonable in your case.

          Consider asking for an internal review. Section 21 applies only to the part of the request where the information that is held by the authority is provided in full elsewhere (perhaps as a download on their website).

          If they wish to withhold some of the information due to another exemption, they need to state why that exemption applies and apply their reasoning in full, including a consideration of the public interest where that applies. Section 21 doesn’t apply to that part of the information.

          <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1203/information-reasonably-accessible-to-the-applicant-by-other-means-sec21.pdf">ICO guidance</a> states “If only part of the requested information is in the public domain, section 21 can only apply to that part of the request", and “If the information is held but is covered by another exemption [...], section 21 cannot apply because, for that very reason, the information is not, in fact, reasonably accessible to the requester".

          When applying a Section 21 exemption, the authority is required to confirm or deny whether they hold the requested information. The authority appears to have acted correctly, but it’s worth checking the information they say is provided elsewhere matches up with what they say they do or do not hold.
