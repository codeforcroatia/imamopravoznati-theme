          The authority appears to have acted correctly in this case â€” but if you think that the decision arrived at after the prejudice test was conducted is the wrong one, and you can make a convincing argument, you may consider requesting an internal review.

          <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1178/commercial-interests-section-43-foia-guidance.pdf">ICO guidance</a> says that this argument can only be applied if future transactions are likely to have a 'degree of similarity' with the one you are asking about.

          Consider whether this is the case - you may have grounds to request an internal review if it is not.

          <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1178/commercial-interests-section-43-foia-guidance.pdf">ICO guidance</a> states that: "It is [...] important for a public authority to consider each clause within a contract, rather than view the contract as a whole. Arguments about the burden this may create are not relevant under section 43".

          You may have grounds for requesting an internal review. Cite the ICO guidance and ask for the other parts of the contract to be released.

          Of necessity, the Public Interest test will reflect the thought processes of the member of staff conducting it, and there may well be room for making a good case against them. <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1178/commercial-interests-section-43-foia-guidance.pdf">ICO guidance</a>, says, for example, that authorities should bear in mind that there is a "strong case for openness and transparency"; for "accountability for the spending of public money", for "promoting competition in procurement via transparency" and for "protect[ing] the public from unsafe products or dubious practices".

          These would, however, be set against the commercial interests of, for example, competition, reputation, ability to generate income and impact on other negotiations.

          If you think you may be able to make a good case for public interest based on one of these premises, read the ICO guidance and consider requesting an internal review.

However information submitted during a tendering process is more likely to be commercially sensitive while the tendering process is ongoing, compared to once the contract has been awarded", although it does also note that some information will remain sensitive, for example if it reveals an approach to business which if known to the public could be commercially damaging.

          You may wish to consider resubmitting your request once some time has passed.
