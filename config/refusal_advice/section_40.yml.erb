        Have you requested '<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/lawful-basis-for-processing/special-category-data/">special category</a>' or 'criminal offence' data?
    hint:
      plain: >
        'Special category' means personal data about an individualâ€™s race, ethnic origin, politics, religion, trade union membership, genetics, biometrics, health, sex life or sexual orientation.

        'Criminal offence' data means "personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures; the alleged commission of offences by the data subject; and proceedings for an offence committed or alleged to have been committed by the data subject or the disposal of such proceedings, including sentencing".

        Has the individual whose data it is given 'explicit consent' for its release, or already clearly made the data public?

        <a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2614720/personal-information-section-40-and-regulation-13-version-21.pdf"">ICO guidance</a> states that for explicit consent, the authority "must have a record that shows that each of the individuals concerned has explicitly and specifically consented to their data being disclosed to the world in response to an FOI or EIR request"; and "there may be situations in which the individual has deliberately done something which has put their special category personal data into the public domain. An obvious example of this would be the political affiliations of a Member of Parliament."
