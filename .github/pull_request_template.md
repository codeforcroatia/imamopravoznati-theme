Please check the following:

- [ ] Whether this PR should include changes to any documentation, or the FAQ;
- [ ] All cobrand-specific commits start their commit message with the cobrand in square brackets;
- [ ] Is new functionality tested? CodeCov will warn you about the diff coverage, but wonâ€™t complain about e.g. new files;
- [ ] Are the changes tested for accessibility?
- [ ] Have you updated the changelog? If this is not necessary, put square brackets around this: skip changelog

Please check the contributing docs, and describe your pull request here.
Screenshots or GIF animations (using e.g. LICEcap) may be helpful.

Please include any issues that are fixed, using "fixes" or "closes" so that
they are auto-closed when the PR is merged.
